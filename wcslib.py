def encode_baseband_signal(b, Tb, fs):

    Encodes a binary sequence into a baseband signal. In particular, generates 
    a discrete-time signal that encodes the binary signal `b` into pulses of 
    width `Tb` seconds at a sampling frequency `fs`, of amplitude 1 (for bits 
    that are 1) and -1 (for bits that are 0).

    To generate the discrete-time signal, the function determines the pulse 
    width in samples that corresponds to the specified parameters `Tb` and 
    `fs`. This is calculated by

        Kb = np.floor(Ts*fs),

    where `Kb` is the pulse width in samples.

    The function also prepends the bits [1, 0] (encoded as [-1, 1]) to the 
    message. These bits are used as a known sequence of bits and used in the 
    decoder (on the receiving side) to determine the time delay between the 
    sender and receiver to synchronize the decoding process with the signal. 

    Parameters
    ----------
    b : numpy.array
        A binary array of 1s and 0s encoding a message.
    Tb : float

def decode_baseband_signal(xm, xp, Tb: float, fs: float):
    """
    Decodes an IQ-demodulated baseband signal consisting of a magnitude signal
    `xm` and a phase signal `xp` into a binary bit sequence.
    
    The bit sequence is recovered by first determining the window of the 
    transmission. This is achieved by averaging the magnitude signal over a 
    sliding window of the length of a symbol (`Tb`) (implemented using a filter
    with a rect of length `Tb` as the impulse response). Then, the average 
    is compared to a threshold, where the threshold is determined using the 
    tail probability of a chi-squared distribution (in essence, the test checks
    whether there is a signal or only noise with a probability of 99 %).

    Then, a filter with impulse response consisting of two pulses corresponding
    to the mirrored synchronization sequence is used to find the first 
    occurence of this pulse sequence in the signal. This corresponds to 
    correlating the signal with the synchronization sequence and is used to 
    determine the time delay introduced by filters and the transmission itself
    (i.e., to synchronize the data stream).
    
    Next, the (averaged) phases of the first two bits are used to find a 
    complex representation of the symbols (which will be different from -1 and
    1 due to the phase shift introduced the transmission and filtering).

    Finally, the whole phase signal is converted to a complex number with angle
    corresponding to the phase shift and bit values are determined by comparing
    averages of length `Tb` to the previously recovered symbols.

    Parameters
    ----------
    xm : numpy.array
        The magnitude of the IQ-demodulated baseband signal.
    xp : numpy.array
        The phase of the IQ-demodulated baseband signal.

    """
    Takes the modulated (discrete-time) signal `x` (generated at sampling 
    frequency `fs`) and simulates a wireless transmission through open space at
    a random distance in the interval from 0 to `dmax` meter. The channel model
    consists of

    * Signal attenuation and delay due to its propagation in space,
    * random noise, and
    * random out-of-channel interference.

    Channel model: The chanel model is based on an exponential decay 
    (attenuation) and time-of-flight-based time-delay, that is,

        y[k] = e^(-eta*d)*x[k - m]

    where `d` is a random distance uniformly drawn on the interval [0, `dmax`]
    and

        m = np.round(d/c*fs)

    Random noise: Random noise is added such that a constant (transmitter) 
    signal-to-noise ratio of `SNR` is achieved.

    Out-of-channel interference: In addition to the random noise, an out-of-
    channel interference is added, which corresponds to a random transmission
    at another frequency. The transmission frequency is sampled uniformly from
    the whole spectrum outside the given channel, while the amplitude is 
    sampled from a Gaussian distribution with mean 1 and standard deviation 
    0.2.
